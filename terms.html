                        <p><strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND NO CLASS ACTION</strong></p>

                        <p>For any dispute you have with CloudGifts, you agree to first contact us by email and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If CloudGifts has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) in connection with, arising out of, or relating to these Terms or the Services (including, but not limited to, your use of the Services) by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and CloudGifts agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in El Dorado County, California, or, if not available in that county, then the nearest applicable county within California. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that you will pay for CloudGifts reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim is frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for expert witnesses and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLOUDGIFTS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>


                        <p><strong>CONFLICTS IN TERMS</strong></p>

                        <p>To the extent that any part of these Terms conflicts with another whether in interpretation, with regards to jurisdiction, in a specific case, in a general case, and/or any other conflict, the part that is more favorable for CloudGifts shall take precedence.</p>


                        <p><strong>SEVERABILITY</strong></p>

                        <p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and, as such, limit that provision to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.&nbsp; Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provisions.</p>


                        <p><strong>ASSIGNMENT</strong></p>

                        <p>These Terms, and any licenses and rights granted hereunder, may not be assigned or transferred by you, but may be assigned or transferred by CloudGifts without restriction. Any attempted assignment or transfer by you in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>


                        <p><strong>TIME LIMIT ON CLAIMS</strong></p>

                        <p>Any dispute, claim, suit, controversy, or action brought by you with respect to any Services or anything related these Terms must be brought, if at all, within one (1) year from the start of such cause of action.</p>


                        <p><strong>CAPITALIZATION OF DEFINITIONS</strong></p>

                        <p>Definitions are the same for all capitalized words and non all capitalized words. For example, "Example Definition" and "EXAMPLE DEFINITION" carry the same meaning as defined.</p>


                        <p><strong>NO WAIVER</strong></p>

                        <p>No waiver by CloudGifts of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other term, and CloudGifts' failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>


                        <p><strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong></p>

                        <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and CloudGifts concerning your use of the Services and Products, and, unless otherwise stated in writing, supersede any prior agreements between you and CloudGifts with respect to the Services and Products. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use, give, receive, or purchase certain other CloudGifts Services or Products, affiliate services, third party products, third party content, or third party software.</p>

                        <p>Any errors and/or ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.</p>

Your use of the Services may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Services or the Terms will be filed only in the state and federal courts located in El Dorado County, California, or, if not available in that county, then the nearest applicable court within California, and you unconditionally and irrevocably agree and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in El Dorado County, California, or, if not available in that county, then the nearest applicable court within California. In the event of a conflict with this section and the arbitration section, the arbitration section shall govern as to the conflicting terms.</p>


                        <p><strong>SECTION TITLES</strong></p>

                        <p>The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
